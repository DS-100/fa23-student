    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Kernel density estimation is used to estimate a probability density function (i.e., a density curve) from a set of data. Just like a histogram, a density function's total area must sum to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "KDE centrally revolves around this idea of a \"kernel\". A kernel is a function whose area sums to 1. The three steps involved in building a kernel density estimate are:\n",
    "1. Placing a kernel at each observation,\n",
    "2. Normalizing kernels so that the sum of their areas is 1, and\n",
    "3. Summing all kernels together.\n",
    "\n",
    "The end result is a function that takes in some value `x` and returns a density estimate at the point `x`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When constructing a KDE, there are several choices to make regarding the kernel. Specifically, we need to choose the function we want to use as our kernel, as well as a bandwidth parameter, which tells us how wide or narrow each kernel should be. We will explore these ideas now."
