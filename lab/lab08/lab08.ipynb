    "Alternatively, we can plot the residuals against our model predictions (fitted values). This is known as the **residual plot**. Ideally, they would all be zero. Given the inevitability of noise, we would at least like them to be scattered randomly across the line where the residual is zero. By contrast, there appears to be a possible pattern with our model consistently underestimating prices for both very low and very high values, and possibly consistently overestimating prices towards the middle range below. We can figure out whether the model is overestimating or underestimating based on the sign of the residual: if it is negative, it means $y_i < \\hat{y}_i$ so we are overestimating prices. Conversely, if the residual is positive, $y_i > \\hat{y_i}$ and we end up underestimating prices."

Here, we consider Ridge Regression, also termed L2 Regularization (in contrast with LASSO Regression or L1 Regularization), as discussed in Lecture 16.
