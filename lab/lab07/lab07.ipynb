    "First, let's convert our features to numerical values. A straightforward approach is to map some of these non-numerical features into numerical ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we could convert the `day` feature to a numerical value from 1-7. However, one of the disadvantages of directly translating to a numeric value is that we unintentionally assign certain features disproportionate weight. Consider assigning Sunday to the numeric value of 7, and Monday to the numeric value of 1. In our linear model, Sunday will have 7 times the influence of Monday, which can (and likely will) lower the performance of our model.\n",

    "Instead, let's use **one-hot encoding** to better represent these features!  As you learned in the lecture, one-hot encoding is a feature engineering method that represents non-numeric features using boolean vectors (numerical values 0 or 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `tips` dataset, for example, we encode Sunday as the row vector `[0 0 0 1]` because our dataset only contains bills from Thursday through Sunday. This replaces the `day` feature with four boolean features indicating if the record occurred on Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday. One-hot encoding therefore assigns a more even weight across each category in non-numeric features.\n",

Note that `OneHotEncoder` transforms data into a [SciPy sparse matrix](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.csr_matrix.html) to save space; we'll need to convert these back into regular arrays before doing any operations on them. Check out `.toarray()` ([documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.csr_matrix.toarray.html)) for how to convert this to a `NumPy` array.\n"
