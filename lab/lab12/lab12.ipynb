    "# Lab 12: Principal Component Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the lecture, we discussed how Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can be used for dimensionality reduction. Specifically, given a high dimensional dataset, PCA allows us to:\n",
    "1. Understand the rank of the data. If $k$ principal components capture almost all of the variance, then the data is roughly rank $k$.\n",
    "2. Create 2D scatterplots of the data. Such plots are a rank 2 representation of our data and allow us to identify clusters of similar observations visually.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will walk through two examples that use PCA: One involving a dataset of iris plants ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_plant)) and another involving an artificial \"surfboard\" 3D dataset. You'll learn how to perform PCA using the `np.linalg` package (Part 1) and build a geometric intuition of PCA to help you understand its strengths (Part 2).\n",
