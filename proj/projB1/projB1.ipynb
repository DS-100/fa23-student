    "## Introduction\n",
    "You will use what you've learned in class to create a binary classifier that can distinguish spam (junk or commercial or bulk) emails from ham (regular non-spam) emails. In addition to providing some skeleton code to fill in, we will evaluate your work based on your model's accuracy and your written responses in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this project, you should feel comfortable with the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Feature engineering with text data,\n",
    "- Using the `sklearn` library to process data and fit models, and\n",
    "- Validate the performance of your model and minimize overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "This first part of the project focuses on initial analysis, Feature Engineering, and Logistic Regression. In the second part of this project (to be released next week), you will build your own spam/ham classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Content Warning\n",
    "This is a **real-world** dataset – the emails you are trying to classify are actual spam and legitimate emails. As a result, some of the spam emails may be in poor taste or be considered inappropriate. We think the benefit of working with realistic data outweighs these inappropriate emails and wanted to give a warning at the beginning of the project so that you are made aware.\n",

Your labeled training dataset contains 8,348 labeled examples, and the unlabeled test set contains 1,000 unlabeled examples.\n",

In future parts of this analysis, we will make use of the data we held out for model validation and comparison.\n",
